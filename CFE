Where YOU Should Study From ..................................................................................

1️⃣ Fraud Prevention & Deterrence (Your hardest)
Primary source: ACFE Fraud Examiners Manual (theory-heavy but required)
Supporting sources:
ACFE Prep Course videos (helps understand concepts quickly)
Flashcards for psychological models / deterrence theories
Tip: Focus on corporate governance, COSO, risk assessment, red flags.

2️⃣ Law (Also hard for non-law background)
Primary source: Fraud Examiners Manual – Legal Section
Supporting sources:
“CFE Law” Udemy course (very simplified explanations)
Legal terminology flashcards
Tip:
Study this section last — it's memory-based.
Practice scenario questions (most law questions are situation-based).

3️⃣ Financial Transactions & Fraud Schemes (Moderate)
Primary source: Fraud Examiners Manual — Financial Transactions Section
Supporting sources:
Any quick refresher of basic accounting (YouTube 3–4 hr crash course)
ACFE practice questions
Tip:
Don’t memorize accounting — focus on fraud schemes (kiting, lapping, skimming, corruption, bribery).

4️⃣ Investigation Techniques (Your easiest)
Primary source: ACFE Manual — Investigation Techniques
Supporting sources:
None required (your background already fits this)
Tip:
This will feel natural because you understand:
✔ Logs, ✔ Evidence trails, ✔ Transaction paths, ✔ Interviewing logic, ✔ System fraud patterns
